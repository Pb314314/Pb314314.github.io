I am currently a Master's student in Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, and a UIUC alumnus.

My technical interests lie in building efficient Machine Learning Systems. I have been fortunate to gain industrial experience through internships at Moonshot AI, AWS, and Nvidia, where I focused on LLM/Multi-modal inference and system efficiency.

Occasionally, I contribute to academic projects—our recent collaborative work was accepted to MLSys '26.

Offline: I'm a huge fan of Eason Chan. You can probably catch me listening to his songs while coding.
